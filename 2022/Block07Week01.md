—DJ Spotlight—

Every time we send out the newsletter, we’re gonna highlight one of our (amazing) DJs!

…starting next time. I don’t wanna say what I have in store _yet_, but it’s gonna be cool!

(…and hilariously over-engineered.)

—Social Medias—

We have a TikTok now! Adrien has been hard at work posting content, go check it out!

Also, speaking of things Adrien has done, they have also compiled a list of songs that we were listening to over spring break, and _that’s_ available on our Instagram!

…and seeing as how two out of our three social medias got mentioned, go check out our twitter for live reminders on the schedule!
