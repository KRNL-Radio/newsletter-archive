Hello!

I'll cut straight to the chase: it's KRNL's 75th anniversary ***today***!!

—75TH ANNIVERSARY—

We'll be doing *two* very important things today:
_Music Trivia_ and _The KRNL 75th Anniversary Show_.

_Music Trivia_ will be on the Orange Carpet (!) starting around 5pm! I (the person who writes these newsletters) don't have knowledge of how difficult the trivia is going to be, but it *will* be fun and chaotic! (There may or may not be something for the winners, don't quote me on that though. I'm not in charge of that. There should be if I have anything to say about it, though!)

_The KRNL 75th Anniversary Show_ will be on the Orange Carpet (if all goes well) starting around 6pm (if not earlier), and lasting until... well whenever I call it quits.

And, as always, we're always live on our [website](https://krnl-radio.github.io). Additionally, we're sometimes played in Thomas Commons (we're still trying to get stuff fully arranged)!

Happy 75th anniversary, KRNL! Video sure as heck couldn't kill us, and neither can streaming, apparently.

Have a great day!
