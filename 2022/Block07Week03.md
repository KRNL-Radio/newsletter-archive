Hello and welcome back to the second edition of KRNL’s newsletter!

(Yes yes this was supposed to come out yesterday but I was busy. ~~Go team nessie!~~)

—PSAs—

Get ready for course scheduling! It happens *really soon* (next week soon. this week soon? soon.). Check your email for your specific time to schedule your courses.

Get ready for JenCon! JenCon is CnG's yearly "convention" where they reserve the *entirety* of Thomas Commons and run a ton of events, which are all hosted by students (or the occasional alumni), and it's happening over this block break! The schedule can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nfp7V9-YT9aaegz1TDYqUjtplyc-aivRUlQl-aljiYQ/edit). If you would like to host an event, get in contact with an officer of CnG!

—Social Medias—

We have a YouTube channel, apparently! It's not much, considering that we can't upload much to it, but we *can* upload our shorts and past editions of CCPR, so that's nice!

In other, somewhat unrelated, news, we're working on a ""small"" playlist for song recommendations over the summer. Additionally, some DJs (namely me) are going to be making playlists that mimic our shows, just incase you *really* miss our shows. We'll have more info on that as summer approaches.

—Special Events—

_April 17th_ - KRNL's 75th Anniversary!

_April 15th(-ish)_ - Next Edition of the newsletter gets sent out (hopefully)!

And, as always, we're always live on our [website](https://krnl-radio.github.io). Additionally, we're sometimes played in Thomas Commons (we're still getting things worked out before we guarentee anything)!

—Schedule—

<schedule_image(2022,7,3)><schedule_image(2022,7,4)>

Same thing as last time, mostly. The block break is *fast* approaching, so take anything past the 12th with a grain of salt (until the 17th. *WE GOT PLANS!*).

Until next time, take care!
